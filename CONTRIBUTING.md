### Pre-reqs
* Install Node.js [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* > npm install
* > npm run dev
* check http://localhost:8080/

## Here we go

*note: do not edit 'index.html', 'package.json', 'package-lock.json', or anything in the './public/build/ folder as these are auto-generated by node.*

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine
2. Create a **new branch** with a descriptive name about the task/feature that you're working on. (ex: 'adding-menu')
3. **Publish** the branch to the repository
4. Do the work on that branch by modifying the necessary files.
5. Go to localhost:8080 to test your feature (work you just did)
6. **Commit** your changes to your branch (with a descriptive message)
7. After you're satisfied with your changes (please do some testing), you may open a **Pull Request** to merge into the main branch (or another branch if you're doing some multi-branch stuff)
